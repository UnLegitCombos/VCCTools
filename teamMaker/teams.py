Team Formation Optimizer for Valorant

This script creates balanced teams of 5 players from groups of players
that must stay together. It uses simulated annealing to optimize
team balance based on player ranks and optional tracker scores.

Features two modes:
- BASIC MODE: Original functionality with rank and tracker score balancing
- ADVANCED MODE: Additional features including:
  * Peak rank act weighting (older peak ranks matter less)
  * Role balancing for team compositions  
  * Region-based adjustments (non-EU players get slight debuff)
  * Previous season stats integration (percentile-based S8/S9 data)

Player scores are exported to player_scores.json by default.

Usage:
    python teams.py  # Create balanced teams and export player scores
    
Configuration:
    Set "mode": "basic" or "advanced" in config.json to choose mode
